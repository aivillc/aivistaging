- All components support optional industry prop
- Components default to generic content when no prop provided (homepage behavior)

================================================================================
HERO COMPONENT - INDUSTRY-SPECIFIC CONTENT (November 10, 2025) - Post v1.0.11
================================================================================

PROMPT: "now replace all the content in the healthcare page with content related to healthcare, following the same logic but make it related to the case"

CHANGES MADE:
1. Updated Hero Component to Accept Industry Prop
   - Added optional `industry` prop: 'Healthcare' | 'Logistics' | 'Real Estate'
   - Added Logistics to industry headlines array
   - When industry prop is provided, displays only that industry's content (no rotation)
   - When no prop, continues rotating through all industries (homepage behavior)
   - Hides industry indicator pills when specific industry is selected

2. Healthcare-Specific Hero Content
   - Title: "Patient Follow-Ups That"
   - Gradient word: "Revenue"
   - Subtitle: "In 13 Seconds"

   - Stat: "67%"
   - No rotation pills shown (fixed to Healthcare content)

   - Hero displays healthcare-specific messaging without rotation

FILES MODIFIED:

TECHNICAL NOTES:
- Other components (Dashboard, Features, Solutions, etc.) currently show generic content
- These components work universally for all industries (analytics, multi-channel AI, integrations)
- To make ALL sections industry-specific would require major component refactoring
- Current approach: Hero is industry-specific, other sections are industry-agnostic

NEXT ITERATION OPTIONS:
1. Create healthcare-specific versions of each component (duplicate code)
2. Refactor all components to accept industry props (large refactor)  
3. Keep current approach: targeted hero, universal components

PREVIOUS: Global Session ID System (November 8, 2025)
================================================================================

PROMPT: "Always use a single global sessionID until its cleared, so form session ID and chat sessionID should always be the same"

CHANGES MADE:
1. Created Global Session Management System
   - Created: lib/globalSession.ts
   - Provides single source of truth for session ID
   - Functions: getGlobalSessionId(), clearGlobalSession()
   - Uses 'aivi_global_session_id' localStorage key
   - Ensures form and chat always share the same session ID

2. Updated ChatBot to Use Global Session
   - Modified: components/ChatBot.tsx
   - Removed generateSessionId import
   - Imports getGlobalSessionId and clearGlobalSession
   - useState initialization: getGlobalSessionId()
   - Cache expiration: clearGlobalSession() then getGlobalSessionId()
   - Close chat: clearGlobalSession() then getGlobalSessionId()
   - Removed obsolete form session ID check logic

3. Updated DemoForm to Use Global Session
   - Modified: components/DemoForm.tsx
   - Removed generateSessionId import
   - Imports getGlobalSessionId
   - Uses getGlobalSessionId() in handleContactSubmit
   - Removed obsolete 'aivi_form_session_id' localStorage logic
   - Console log updated: "Form data saved to global session"

PROBLEM SOLVED:
❌ BEFORE: Form created session_ABC, Chat created session_XYZ (different IDs)
✅ AFTER: Both form and chat use same session_ABC from global manager

FEATURES IMPLEMENTED:
✅ Single global session ID shared across entire site
✅ Form data immediately available in chat
✅ Chat data immediately available in form
✅ Session data flows correctly to Slack channels
✅ Clean session lifecycle (clear → create new)
✅ Works regardless of which component user interacts with first

TESTING WORKFLOW:
1. User fills form → Global session ID created: session_XYZ
2. All form data saved under session_XYZ
3. User opens chat → Uses same session_XYZ
4. Chat has immediate access to form data
5. User requests agent → Slack channel shows complete user information
6. Reverse order (chat first, form second) works identically
