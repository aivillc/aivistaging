---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ACTION: Fixed TypeScript configuration for Next.js compatibility
CHANGES:
  - Modified: tsconfig.json
    * Changed "jsx": "react-jsx" to "jsx": "preserve"
    * Reason: Next.js uses its own JSX transform and requires "preserve" mode

PROMPT 3: "fix all of the issues of the code"
----------------------------------------------
ACTION: Removed unnecessary React import from Dashboard.tsx
CHANGES:
  - Modified: components/Dashboard.tsx

  - Installed: 426 npm packages including React, Next.js, TypeScript types
  - Created: node_modules directory with all dependencies

PROMPT 7: "I installed the live server but its just showing a listing directory instead of the preview of the site"
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ACTION: Started Next.js development server
CHANGES:
  - Started: npm run dev (Next.js development server)
  - Opened: http://localhost:3000 in Simple Browser

ACTION: Fixed horizontal scrollbar issue
CHANGES:
  - Modified: app/globals.css

    * Modified body: Added overflow-x: hidden;
    * Reason: Prevents horizontal scrolling from viewport-overflowing elements

PROMPT 10: "Can you create a file named 'changes-made.txt'..."
---------------------------------------------------------------
