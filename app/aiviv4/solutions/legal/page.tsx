    question: 'How does AIVI handle attorney-client confidentiality?',

  {
    question: 'Will AIVI accidentally give legal advice?',

  },
  {
    question: 'How does conflict checking work?',
    answer: 'AIVI collects party names, opposing counsel, and relevant entities, then cross-references your conflict database in real-time. Potential conflicts are flagged immediately for attorney review before any consultation is scheduled.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Can AIVI qualify personal injury cases?',

  {
    question: 'What ROI do law firms typically see?',
    answer: 'Firms report 3x more consultations from the same marketing spend by capturing after-hours leads. With average case values of $5,000-50,000+ and AIVI\'s monthly cost equivalent to a few billable hours, most firms see significant ROI from their first signed case.',
