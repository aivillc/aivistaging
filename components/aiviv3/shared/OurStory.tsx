          The $1.2 Million Problem (Discovered Twice)

          <p>
            In 2023, Giorgio and Olly were solving the same problem from opposite sides of the industry, without knowing it.
          </p>
          <p>
            Giorgio had just finished scaling Amazon Connect to 100,000 agents across 22 countries and building Five9&apos;s global expansion. Everywhere he looked, he saw the same pattern: companies spending $50-100 per lead were losing 55% of them to slow follow-up.
          </p>
          <p>
            At the same time, Olly was running a digital agency managing $100M in annual ad spend. His clients kept blaming &quot;bad lead quality&quot; but the leads were fine. The problem was simple: by the time they called back 23 minutes later, competitors had already gotten there.
          </p>
          <p>
            When we met through a mutual contact center industry connection, we realized we were diagnosing the exact same $1.2M problem:
          </p>

          <div className="bg-[#f8f8f8] rounded-xl p-6 my-8 border border-[#e5e5e5]">
            <ul className="space-y-2 text-[16px] sm:text-[17px]">

              </li>
              <li className="flex items-center gap-2">
                <span className="text-[#f84608]">•</span>
                <span>55% never contacted (23-minute response time)</span>
              </li>
              <li className="flex items-center gap-2">
                <span className="text-[#f84608]">•</span>
                <span className="font-semibold text-[#1A1A1A]">$550K wasted every single month</span>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </div>

          <p>
            Giorgio had the contact center AI expertise. Olly had the lead generation data. Together, we had the complete picture.
          </p>

          <p>
            Existing AI tools didn&apos;t solve this. They were either too generic (built for every industry, mastered none),
            single-vendor (locked to OpenAI, failed when it went down), voice-only (ignored SMS and email channels),
            or had no learning engine (static, didn&apos;t optimize).
          </p>
          <p>
            So we built AIVI, the AI Revenue Engine specifically for lead generation companies. Multi-channel (SMS, voice, email),
            AI-agnostic (routes to best provider automatically), with a learning engine that optimizes channel, timing,
            messaging, and routing continuously.
